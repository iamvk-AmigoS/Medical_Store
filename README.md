# Medical Store
Today almost every service platform is digital specially the shoping stores, but the Medical Stores remain as it is. This 
Web-App will help the Medical Store owners to run there buisness online easily and successfully.

## Getting Started
One who is wishing to use this just has to download the whole directory, then create your database as mention in the 
**database.pdf** file and test it.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed the following in your server PC
* [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
* [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads/)
* [APACHE http server](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi)

Latest versions would be preferable.

### Installing :arrow_down:
Using the above links one can install the required software. I have implemented this project in Ubuntu 16.04 OS, use of which
would be highly recommended. Though other OS won't require much changes.

### Details
In current scenario of online pharmacy people have to first search thier medicine in different pharmacies, then give order and
wait till it reaches.
In other scenarios where a person need medicine immediately and if not found in regular store then he has to rush each and
every store to find it.

My solution is simple. A person just need to search his medicine on the website and if found he can also see the availability
plus price of the medicine, if not found he can request it too. Saving both time and money.

### Finished Product
Finished product should look like this.
